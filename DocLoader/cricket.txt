Where willow meets the leather sphere in cricket's grand display,
The pitch lies flat and waiting, twenty-two yards of sacred ground,
Where heroes rise and fall with grace, where glory can be found.

Where every ball's a story told, each run can steal the heart,
From village greens to hallowed Lord's, your spirit never dies,
Beneath Australia's burning sun or England's cloudy skies.

The spinner comes with guile and craft, the ball grips, turns and bites,
Creating doubt in batsmen's minds, bringing sleepless nights,

The crowd erupts when boundaries flow, their voices loud and clear,
A six soars high above the rope, majestic in its flight,
